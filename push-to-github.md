# Push to GitHub - Quick Steps

## Step 1: Create the Repository on GitHub

1. Go to: https://github.com/new
2. Repository name: **GSI** (must be exactly "GSI")
3. Description (optional): "Custom Software Solutions for Small Business"
4. **Make it Public** (required for free GitHub Pages)
5. **DO NOT** check any boxes (no README, .gitignore, or license - we already have these)
6. Click **"Create repository"**

## Step 2: After Creating the Repo

Once you've created the repository, come back here and I'll push the code for you!

Or you can run this command yourself:
```bash
git push -u origin main
```

## Step 3: Enable GitHub Pages

After the code is pushed:
1. Go to: https://github.com/GSIntelligence/GSI/settings/pages
2. Under "Source", select: **GitHub Actions**
3. Save the settings

## Step 4: Wait for Deployment

- Go to: https://github.com/GSIntelligence/GSI/actions
- You'll see a workflow running
- Wait for it to complete (usually 1-2 minutes)
- Your site will be live at: **https://GSIntelligence.github.io/GSI/**

**Note:** The remote is already configured, so once you create the repo, just let me know and I'll push the code!
